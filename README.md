# MyMovies
This is Popular Movies Stage 1 of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to built an app that helps users discover popular and top rated movies on the web. It fetches themoviedb.org API to display the movies data, that way the content provided is always up-to-date and relevant.
